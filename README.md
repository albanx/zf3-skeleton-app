#Zend Framework 3 Skeleton App

Some months ago Zend released finally the third version of Zend framework. The main problem
of this great powerful framework has been the lack of documentation or organization.

I cloned from the offical Skeleton App and added working Services and Model system.

This is the first commit so this skeleton app is still in alpha.

## Features
- Better Model system
- Multiple database management
- JWT authentication
- Database creation/migration scripts
- Model creation scripts

## TODO
- Write better code
- Comment the code
- Provide social authentication
